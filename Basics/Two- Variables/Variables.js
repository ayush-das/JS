//Primitive / Value Types
//JS,Python, Php is a Dynamic Language since we can change data type on the go

//Static Languages We can chage Values but not type -- C,C++,JAVA,GO

//String
let x = "Hello"

console.log(x);
console.log(typeof(x));
x = 10
console.log(x);

//Decimal type is Number in JS
let y = 1

console.log(y);
console.log(typeof(y));

//Float type is Number in Js

let z = 1.4

console.log(z);
console.log(typeof(z));

//Boolean

let p = true

console.log(p);
console.log(typeof(p));

//Undefined Type By default

let w

console.log(w);
console.log(typeof(w));

w = "Ayush"

console.log(w);
console.log(typeof(w));

//We are not supposed to assign undefined it will not give error but it is not good Practice

//We can keep Null which is an Object
